\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Discuss how atmosphere affects photometry
	
	\item Discuss needs to constrain atmospheric transmission temporal and spatial structure functions
	
	\item Discuss how these functions will dictate how the AuxTel will move in coordination with LSST.
	
\end{itemize}
